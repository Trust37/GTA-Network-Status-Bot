Yes i know, the code is pretty dirty. This is my first nodejs application ever so please don't judge me :smile_cat:

Build with

* [cjson](https://github.com/kof/node-cjson)

Should be enough.

Actually, the bot could create an automated message. But since I'm tracking the Server with another script it's not necessary to create a message with the bot. The message on discord is just an information so everyone in the channel is aware of the issue.
